(How NLP Cracked Transfer Learning)”](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/), walks you through some of them, namely:\n","\n","* ELMo \\[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365)\\] (Embeddings from Language Models). These embeddings are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large text corpus. It gives deep contextualized word representations that model both complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy). [Here](https://tfhub.dev/google/elmo/1) is a good tutorial on how to use ELMo embeddings with TF Hub.\n","\n","* BERT \\[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)\\] (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). These embeddings are based on the Transformer architecture, which [has been introduced in 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) and since then become the leading model both in NLP and other areas. You can also read about Transformers [in this blogpost](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/). Pretrained BERT embeddings can be found in [the official repository of Google-Research](https://github.com/google-research/bert). Training BERT embeddings from scratch is computationally expensive, so people usually use / fine-tune the existing general purpose embeddings.\n","\n","In this assignment, we will pick the StarSpace model to play with, because it’s better suited to the duplicate detection task and can be trained with moderate resources. Please follow the notebook - the training pipeline is provided below. Once you have obtained the embeddings, please keep them for the final project of the course - you will need them again. \n","\n","\n","### StarSpace\n","\n","[StarSpace](https://github.com/facebookresearch/StarSpace) is an algorithm proposed by Facebook. It is a general-purpose neural model for efficient learning of entity embeddings for solving a wide variety of problems.\n","\n","Unfortunately, StarSpace cannot be run on Windows and we recommend to use provided\n","[docker container](https://github.com/hse-aml/natural-language-processing/blob/master/Docker-tutorial.md) or other alternatives. Don't delete results of this task because you will need it in the final project.\n","\n","### How it works and what's the main difference with word2vec?\n","The main point in this section is that StarSpace can be trained specifically for some tasks. In contrast to word2vec model, which tries to train similar embeddings for words in similar contexts, StarSpace uses embeddings for the whole sentence (just as a sum of embeddings of words and phrases). Despite the fact that in both cases we get word embeddings as a result of the training, StarSpace embeddings are trained using some supervised data, e.g. a set of similar sentence pairs, and thus they can better suit the task.\n","\n","In our case, StarSpace should use two types of sentence pairs for training: \"positive\" and \"negative\". \"Positive\" examples are extracted from the train sample (duplicates, high similarity) and the \"negative\" examples are generated randomly (low similarity assumed). \n","\n","### How to choose the best params for the model?\n","Normally, you would start with some default choice and then run extensive experiments to compare different strategies. However, we have some recommendations ready for you to save your time:\n","- Be careful with choosing the suitable training mode. In this task we want to explore texts similarity which corresponds to *trainMode = 3*.\n","- Use adagrad optimization (parameter *adagrad = true*).\n","- Set the length of phrase equal to 1 (parameter *ngrams*), because we need embeddings only for words.\n","- Don't use a large number of *epochs* (we think that 5 should be enough).\n","- Try dimension *dim* equal to 100.\n","- To compare embeddings usually *cosine* *similarity* is used.\n","- Set *minCount* greater than 1 (for example, 2) if you don't want to get embeddings for extremely rare words.\n","- Parameter *verbose = true* could show you the progress of the training process.\n","- Set parameter *fileFormat* equals *labelDoc*.\n","- Parameter *negSearchLimit* is responsible for a number of negative examples which is used during the training. We think that 10 will be enought for this task.\n","- To increase a speed of training we recommend to set *learning rate* to 0.05."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8i3r2QtkhILd"},"source":["Train StarSpace embeddings for unigrams on the train dataset.
